# ESPboy_OTA
Access to the online "ESPboy App Store" with lots of games and applications using your WiFi network

It’s free, online, and works fine directly from your ESPboy. 
Use this code to get access to the store first-time.

Thanks to DmitryL (Plague) for coding help,
Corax, AlRado, Torabora, MLXXXP for tests and advices.

Connect to WiFi, chose any firmware, and upload the application or game in a minute without any wires, IDE's, looking for right libraries, compilations, fighting errors, and bugs, etc. The same simple way as you get the new app for your smartphone.

There are few Arduboy and LGE games available in this store now, Shiru’s “SystemBeeps” music album. 
Coming soon ZX games, ESPboy Module Apps, and much more! Stay tuned.
